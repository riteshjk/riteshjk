### About Me

New technologies have always piqued my interest. I first heard about coding when I was in college. I further developed a strong fondness for Web Development while trying my hands at it during the lockdown. That is when I decided that it was high time to learn coding in a more outcome-focused manner.

### Full Stack Web Developer

I joined Masai School, which offers a 30 weeks full-time course on Full-stack web development programs. At Masai school, I got hands-on experience to learn frontend and backend technologies.

### What do I do for Fun?
  
  - I play Mobile Games
  - Love to play Cricket
